<?php
# $_POST['var_name'] is an associative array, ie an array where the elements are not accessed by a subscript but rather key-value pairs.
# The post data is supplied as keyword value pairs to the server, however the php system parses this into the _POST associative array.

# isset() Check whether there is an assignment/input of variables and return the logical value to response.
